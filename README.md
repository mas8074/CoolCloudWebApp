# CoolCloudWebApp
A Cloud hosted WebApp developed using .NET deployed to Azure. Used to test and enhance my skills in .NET, Azure DevOps, Azure, and general web development.

As a recent college graduate, I realized I haven't really spent much time developing. During school I had small projects and then senior project, which lasted two semesters. But I never really felt like I got a chance to improve my skills.

Even at my new job, I spend most of my time assisting others with tasks, testing, debugging, and fixing defects. 

This is why I decided to start this project. I'm going to do everything that I think we should do at work to maintain a good process, product quality, and good development. 

This will begin with research into what process is best for a single developer, research into what testing framework I should use, proper architecture for a cloud hosted web app, etc.

Once I have a design and a set process I will begin development.
